      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I am Shieh Ying, 28 this year.<br />
        I am currently working in a Japanese pharmacutical company since
        December 2021.<br />
        I gained some interest in the software engineering world and currently
        doing some courses to get me started. <br />
        At this point in time, I am learning html, CSS and python. Once I am
        more familiar with these, I am planing to pick up javascript.<br />
        My goal is to be able to land on a software engineering career in 1 to 2
        years time.<br />
        Until then, I will sharpen my arsenal with mini projects that I intent
        to work on. Keep a lookout at my portfolio! <br />
        Happy coding! (\)=^.^=(/)<br />

        Back in the day, I was not sure what major to pursue. Therefore I
        decided to continue to expand my knowledge in chemical engineering. It
        was not easy but I am glad that I was able to complete my degree.
